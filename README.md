# Web_Scraping


This includes Web Scraping on different sites which are noted below. I've used Beautiful Soup and Requests (well known libraries for web scraping in python). The major things to note while scraping is to choose which parser to be used, which tage to be selected, and simple python and pandas syntax to get the scraped data to the form of a csv file.
